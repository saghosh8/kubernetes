# Basic Web Application Deployment

This repository contains the configuration files for deploying a basic web application using Docker and Kubernetes. Below you'll find instructions on how to build and deploy your application using GitHub Actions.

## Contents

- `Dockerfile`: The Dockerfile used to build the Docker image for the web application.
- `kubernetes/deployment.yaml`: Kubernetes Deployment manifest.
- `kubernetes/service.yaml`: Kubernetes Service manifest.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for building and deploying the application.

## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up GitHub Secrets

Before running the workflow, you need to set up the following GitHub secrets in your repository:

- `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
- `DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub access token.
- `KUBERNETES_SERVER`: The API server URL of your Kubernetes cluster.
- `KUBERNETES_TOKEN`: The authentication token for your Kubernetes cluster.
- `KUBERNETES_CA_CERT` (optional): The CA certificate for your Kubernetes cluster, if required.

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow

The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file contains the GitHub Actions workflow for building and deploying the application. This workflow will:

1. **Build and Push Docker Image**:
   - Build the Docker image defined in the `Dockerfile`.
   - Push the image to Docker Hub.

2. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:
   - Set up `kubectl` to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
   - Apply the Kubernetes manifests from the `kubernetes` directory.

### 3. Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` defines how to build the Docker image for the web application. Ensure this file is correctly configured for your application needs.

### 4. Kubernetes Manifests

- **`kubernetes/deployment.yaml`**: Defines the Deployment for the web application. This manifest specifies how to deploy and manage your application pods.
- **`kubernetes/service.yaml`**: Defines the Service for the web application. This manifest exposes the application to the network and makes it accessible.

### 5. Running the Workflow

Once your GitHub secrets are set up, push your code to the `main` branch. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically trigger, build the Docker image, push it to Docker Hub, and deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster.

### Accessing the Application

After deployment, you can find the external IP of your service by running:

```bash
kubectl get services


Access the web application using the external IP address provided.
