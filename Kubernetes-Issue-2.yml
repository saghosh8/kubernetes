#Kubernetes-Issue-2


#Issue
Your backend-service application is experiencing downtime because 
#it is not configured to automatically restart when it crashes. 
#This is causing prolonged downtime until the issue is manually addressed.

#Solution
#To resolve this issue, you will add a restartPolicy and 
#livenessProbe to the backend-service deployment YAML file to ensure that the service 
#is automatically restarted if it crashes and regularly checked for its health.

#Explanation

#restartPolicy: The restartPolicy: Always ensures that the container is always restarted if it crashes. 
#This is the default policy for Deployments and ensures high availability.

#livenessProbe: The livenessProbe checks the health of the container by sending HTTP GET requests to the specified path and port. 
#If the probe fails, Kubernetes will restart the container.

#By adding a restartPolicy and livenessProbe, you can ensure that your backend-service automatically recovers from crashes and 
#is regularly checked for its health, improving the overall reliability of your application.
