#Issue:
#Your application is not accessible from outside the cluster because there is no Ingress resource configured, 
#making it difficult for users to reach the web application.

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: web-app-ingress  # Name of the Ingress resource
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /  # NGINX specific annotation for URL rewriting
spec:
  rules:
  - host: yourdomain.com  # Replace with your domain
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /  # Path to match
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: web-app-service  # Name of the service that the Ingress routes to
            port:
              number: 80  # Port number of the service


#Explanation:
#Ingress: The Ingress resource manages external access to the services within your cluster.
#rules: Specifies how traffic is routed based on the host and path.
#host: The domain name that users will use to access the application.
#backend: Defines which service the Ingress should route requests to, along with the port.
#annotations: Allows you to customize the behavior of the Ingress controller (like NGINX) for URL rewriting or other features.
#With this configuration, users can access your application using the specified domain, 
#and traffic will be routed to the correct service inside the cluster.
