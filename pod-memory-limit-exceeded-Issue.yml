#Issue: Pod Memory Limit Exceeded
#Description:
#The application is experiencing frequent crashes due to exceeding the allocated memory limits. 
#The current memory limit is set too low for the application's workload, 
#causing the Kubernetes scheduler to terminate the pod when it uses more memory than allocated.

#Proposed Solution:
#Increase the memory limits in the Kubernetes deployment YAML file to ensure the application has sufficient resources to run smoothly.
